We also need to install a package called
'dnsython' in order to use the Mongo SRV connection string.
pip3 install dnspython

The first configuration will be used to grab the database name: app.config["MONGO_DBNAME"]
= os.environ.get("MONGO_DBNAME").
Next, we need to configure the actual connection string, also called the MONGO_URI, which is
done in the same exact way: app.config["MONGO_URI"] = os.environ.get("MONGO_URI").
The final app setting is to grab our SECRET_KEY, which is a requirement when using some of
the functions from Flask: app.secret_key = os.environ.get("SECRET_KEY").

We need to setup an instance of PyMongo, and add the app into that using something called
a constructor method, so type: "mongo = PyMongo(app)".
This is the Flask 'app' object we've defined above, and is the final step to ensure our
